# Project Outline
Task was to develop a Sort Manager which includes different sorting algorithms used to sort an array of numbers. In addition, OOP and SOLID principles were followed. Exceptions and logging is included. 
Furthermore, a Test-Driven Development approach had been used to develop the Binary Tree implementation. In addition, Unit Testing and Performance testing was included using JUnit 5.

# Algorithms Included
* Bubble Sort
* Merge Sort
* Binary Tree Search

# How to use
1. In Starter.java input desired numbers and size of the array to be sorted.
2. Use the switch cases to select the desired sorting algorithm to be used.
3. Run the application in Main.java.

# The program outputs:
* The unsorted array (User defined)
* The sort algorithm to be used
* The sorted array after the algorithm has been executed
* The time taken

# Tools used
* IntelliJ
* JDK11
* Maven
* JUnit 5
* Log4J
* Git
